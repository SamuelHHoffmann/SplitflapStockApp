# SplitflapStockApp 
#### A simple stock displaying app by Samuel Hoffmann

## About: 
This app was built around a splitflap text view by yannickl **[yannickl](https://github.com/yannickl)** found here: **[Splitflap](https://github.com/yannickl/Splitflap)**. The motivation of this build was for a coding challenge by the **[CodeWithChris](https://codecrew.codewithchris.com/t/current-the-stock-tracker-app-challenge/11771/2)** youtube channel. Veiw a demo of the app running  on my **[Youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNWlcl_btUE)** ![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GNWlcl_btUE/0.jpg)
